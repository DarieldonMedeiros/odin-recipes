    <h1>Air Fryer French Fries</h1>
    <img src="../images/fries.jpg" alt="French Fries" style="width: 600px;">
    <p>This air fryer French fries recipe includes a cold water-hot water soaking trick that produces super crispy French fries. Made with just four ingredients, these fries rival traditional fries but use a fraction of the oil. Serve with burgers, steak, or chicken with something to dip them in, like honey mustard, spicy ketchup, or garlic aioli.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
        <li>1 pound russed potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayene pepper</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol style="list-style-position: inside;">
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Cut each potato lengthwise into 3/8-inch-thick slices, then slice sections into 3/8-inch-wide sticks. Place potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Let soak to release excess starches, about 5 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Pour boiling water over the potatoes until they're covered by a few inches. Let sit for 10 minutes. Drain potatoes and transfer onto some paper towels. Blot off excess water and let cool completely, at least 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place cooled potatoes in a mixing bowl. Drizzle with oil and season with cayenne; toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stack potatoes in a double layer in the fryer basket.</li>
        <li>Cook for 15 minutes. Slide basket out and toss fries. Continue frying until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Toss fries with salt in a mixing bowl. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Chef's Notes</h3>
    <p>Go with russet potatoes for best results. Yellow/gold potatoes may work, but red potatoes would not work.</p>

    <p>Season these however you like, but I like to wait until the end to add salt.</p>
