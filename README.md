# Odin Recipes

## About

This is a simple website that shows three recipes, when you click you are redirected to the selected recipe! All recipes are from [AllRecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com).

This is my [Odin Recipe](https://darieldonmedeiros.github.io/odin-recipes/)

I had to zoom out on the recipe pages to fit all the recipes.

Any and all changes to this project are welcome!

## Recipes

1. Spaghetti alla Carbonara
2. Churrascaria-Style Picanha
